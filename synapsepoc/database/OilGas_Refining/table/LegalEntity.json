A board of directors of a corporation is not a legal entity or 'legal person' in that it has no ability to exercise legal rights independent of the corporation that they are part of.",

					"Description": "There are eight (8) types of business relationships defined in D&B WorldBase:\n\nSingle Location Subsidiary\n\nA single location subsidiary has reporting responsibilities to its parent; however, it does not have branches or subsidiaries reporting to it. Do not confuse this with a stand-alone business which is titled \"single location\" and is not part of a corporate family.\n\nHeadquarters\n\nA headquarters is a business establishment that has branches or divisions reporting to it, and is financially responsible for those branches or divisions. If the headquarters is more that 50% owned by another corporation, it also will be a subsidiary. If it owns more that 50% of another corporation, then it is also a parent.\n\nBranch\n\nA branch is a secondary location of its headquarters. It has no legal responsibility for its debts, even though bills may be paid from the branch location. It will have the same legal business name as its headquarters, although branches frequently operate under a different trade style than the headquarters establishment. A branch may be located at the same address as the headquarters if it has a unique trade style. In such cases, the branch may appear to be a duplicate with a different D-U-N-S number than the headquarters record, which may confuse customers if they don't purchase the trade style field.\n\nDivision\n\nA division, like a branch, is a secondary location of a business. However, a division carries out specific business operations related to the headquarters under a divisional name. Divisions look similar to branches in D&B WorldBase and carry a branch code.\n\nSubsidiary\n\nA subsidiary is a corporation that is more than 50% owned by another corporation and will have a different legal business name from its parent company. A subsidiary may have branches and/or subsidiaries of its own. If it does, then its D-U-N-S Number appears in the headquarter/parent D-U-N-S Number field of its children.\n\nParent\n\nA parent is a corporation that owns more than 50 percent of another corporation. The parent company also may be a subsidiary of another corporation. If the parent also has branches, then it is also a headquarters.\n\nDomestic Ultimate\n\nThe Domestic Ultimate is a subsidiary within the global family tree which is the highest ranking member within a specific country.\n\nGlobal Ultimate\n\nThe Global Ultimate is the top most responsible entity within the global family tree. The Global Ultimate may have branches and/or subsidiaries reporting directly or indirectly to it.",

			"Description": "A Legal Entity (\"juristic person\") is a non-human entity that the law treats for some purposes as if it were a person, such as an incorporated organization. \n\nThe law allows them to act as persons for certain limited purposes-most commonly lawsuits, property ownership, and contracts.\n\nA Legal Entity has a \"legal personality\" that refers to the ability of an organization to enter into legal transactions such as holding property or entering into debt.\n\nLegal Entities may enter into legal transactions such as the holding property or entering into debt. \n\nEx:\n\n- Companies \n- Cooperatives  \n- Corporations \n- Limited Liability Companies (LLC)\n- Municipalities \n- Partnerships \n- Sovereigns\n- States\n- Trade Unions\n\nNote:\nNot all organizations have legal personhood. A board of directors of a corporation is not a legal entity or 'legal person' in that it has no ability to exercise legal rights independent of the corporation that they are part of.",
