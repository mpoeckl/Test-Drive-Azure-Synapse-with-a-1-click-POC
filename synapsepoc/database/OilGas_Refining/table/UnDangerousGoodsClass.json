MISCELLANEOUS DANGEROUS SUBSTANCES\n\nClasses of dangerous goods\nThe United Nations has published a book collecting the work of the Committee of Experts: Recommendations on the Transport of Dangerous Goods. These recommendations aim to present a basic, practical scheme of provisions that will allow national and international regulations governing various modes of transport to develop within it in a certain uniformity. The aim is to enable effective and successive transport and to ensure the safety of people, property, and the environment. \nIn these recommendations the goods are given an identification number and are divided into the following classes describing the inherent hazards: \n\nEXPLOSIVES  \nSubstances and articles which have a mass explosion hazard  \nSubstances and articles which have a projection hazard but not a mass explosion hazard  \nSubstances and articles which have a fire hazard and either a minor blast hazard or a minor projection hazard but not a mass explosion hazard  \nSubstances and articles which present no significant hazard  \nVery insensitive substances which have a mass explosion hazard  \nExtremely insensitive articles which do not have a mass explosion hazard  \nGASES  \nFlammable gases  \nNon-flammable, non-toxic gases  \nToxic gases  \nFLAMMABLE LIQUIDS  \nFLAMMABLE SOLIDS  \nFlammable solids  \nSubstances liable to spontaneous combustion  \nSubstances which in contact with water emit flammable gases  \nOXIDIZING SUBSTANCES; ORGANIC PEROXIDES  \nOxidizing substances  \nOrganic peroxides  \nPOISONOUS (=TOXIC) SUBSTANCES  \nToxic substances  \nInfectious substances  \nRADIOACTIVE MATERIAL  \nCORROSIVE SUBSTANCES  \nMISCELLANEOUS DANGEROUS SUBSTANCES  \nThe properties of the chemical substance or product have an effect on the choice of the packing material. Recommendations on the material, as well as the sizes, of packages are based on testing and experience. Dangerous goods of classes 3, 4, 5.1, 6.1, 8, and 9 have been divided for packing purposes into three groups according to the degree of danger they present: \ngreat danger - Packing Group I  \nmedium danger - Packing Group II  \nminor danger - Packing Group III  \nThe packing group related to a special substance, together with advice on packing methods, is listed in 'UN Recommendations on the Transport of Dangerous Goods' and in many national provisions. \nTo deal with goods having multiple risks a 'subsidiary risk' classification is used together with the principal hazard classification. \n\nSubstances and articles belonging to classes 1, 2, 4.1, 4.2, 4.3, 5.2, 6.2 and 7 often have more than one hazardous property and are subject to further restrictions. \n\nThese goods may be  \n\nexplosive  \nliable to spontaneous ignition or combustion  \nliberate flammable gases on contact with water  \ncontain infectious microorganisms that are known or reasonably believed to cause disease in animals or humans  \nradioactive  \ncompressed, condensed or pressurized dissolved gases, or organic peroxides  \nExamples of hazard classes: \n Substance or article Hazards \n UN Number Name and description Class Subsidiary risk \n 3017 Organophosphorus pesticides, liquid, flammable, flash-point not less than 23°C (Demeton, Fenthion, Parathion) 6.1 3 \n 1396 Aluminum powder, uncoated 4.3  \n 1005 Ammonia, solution with water, with more than 50% ammonia 2.3 8 \n 1789 Hydrochloric acid, solution 8  \n 1011 Butane 2.1  \n 2.1 Class 1. Explosives\nThis class contains articles, preparations, and substances such as ammunition, TNT, dynamite, nitrourea, fireworks. \nRisks involved \n\nA transport accident involves acute risk of explosion. The pressure wave can be devastating, and flying splinters may cause great damage. \n\nThe heat of the blast can result in a fire. \n\nSome substances in this class have toxic properties, e.g. nitroglycerin (in dynamite) is also classified as toxic and can penetrate through the skin. \n\nTransport of Class 1 articles or substances are subject to many restrictions, including quantity and temperature limits. They may also be incompatible with other goods. For example, dynamite should not go with detonators. \n\nPicture 26 \nPicture 27 \n\n2.2 Class 2. Gases\nThis class contains \ncompressed gases  \nliquefied gases  \nrefrigerated liquefied gases  \ncompressed gases, which, when packed for transport, are dissolved into a solvent.  \nThe term \"compressed\" refers to gases under pressure but not in a liquid state. Gases are usually stored in cylinders. When the valve is opened or broken, gas alone is released. The pressure of the cylinder depends on the type of gas it contains. The cylinders should always be kept within the approved temperature range to avoid a risk of overpressure causing an explosion hazard. Nitrogen (Class 2.2), hydrogen (2.1), oxygen (2.2 and 5.1) and helium (2.2) are compressed gases. \nCondensed gases are in a liquid state at relative low pressure. The contents are released as liquids which quickly evaporate forming gas clouds. \n\nThe size of the cloud can be considerable; for example, 1 liter of liquefied petroleum gas (LPG) forms up to 250 liters of gas. LPG, (propane, butane or a mixture of them, 'cooking gas')(Class 2.1); propene (2.1); vinyl chloride (2.1); freons; carbon dioxide (2.2); chlorine (2.3 and 5.1); ammonia (2.3 and 8) are commonly used gases in industry and are transported as condensed gases. \n\nSome condensed gases are stored at very low temperatures. They are transported in well- isolated containers called dewars. These must have a loosely covered opening to avoid dangerous overpressure. They pose special hazards due to their low temperature. For example, splashes of liquefied nitrogen can cause frostbite and the gas cloud is an asphyxiant. \n\nIn a train accident several tank wagons filled with liquefied propane turned over spilling their contents. The propane started to evaporate cooling the surroundings to -43oC, which is the boiling temperature of propane. Several persons in the spill area were frozen to death. With good luck and tight security the highly flammable propane gas did not explode. \n\nAn example of a dissolved gas is acetylene (Class 2.1). Acetylene cylinders are filled with inert very porous, non-combustible material which is wetted with acetylene. \n\nAerosols and small receptacles which contain flammable propellant gases belong to this class. \n\nRisks involved \n\nSubstances in Class 2 are assigned to one of three categories based on the primary hazard of the gas. \n\n2.2.1 Class 2.1. Flammable gases\nThis category includes those gases that at normal pressure and temperature, as a mixture of 13% or less with air, can ignite from a source of fire such as a spark. \n2.2.2 Class 2.2. Non-flammable, non-toxic gases\nIncluded in this category are gases which might replace oxygen and are asphyxiant (nitrogen, carbon dioxide), or which are oxidizing and may contribute to the combustion of other materials more than air does (pure oxygen is an example). \n2.2.3 Class 2.3. Toxic gases\nGases which are known to be poisonous or corrosive enough to pose a health hazard belong to this category (carbon monoxide, ethylene oxide, hydrogen sulfide, sulfur dioxide and ammonia). Containers with toxic gases should never be loaded or stored together with food or feedstuffs. \nAcidic gases can react with alkaline gases to produce heat and smoke, which may create a fire risk. \n\nSome gases have more than one dangerous property. They can be both flammable and toxic (methyl ether) or corrosive and toxic (hydrogen chloride, phosgene, chlorine). \n\n2.3 Class 3. Flammable liquids\nA flammable liquid has the ability to give of, at normal temperatures, vapors which are flammable (e.g., benzene, kerosene, toluene, propanol and various organic solvents used in pesticides). This class also covers mixtures of liquids, as well as liquids containing solids in solution or suspension (paints, varnishes, lacquers, etc.). Petroleum products and crude oil also belong to Class 3. \nRisks involved \n\nFlammable liquids pose a risk of fire and explosion, and may lead to expensive environmental clean- up operations (accidents at sea to oil tankers). \n\nThe flammability of a liquid depends on several characteristic properties. \n\nFlash-point describes the lowest temperature at which a liquid gives off sufficient amount of flammable gas to form a mixture with air which will ignite when a flame or spark is present. If the flash-point is tested to be not more than 60.5°C, the substance belongs to Class 3. \n\nMany flammable liquids can be charged with static electricity, for example, as result of flowing in a pipe. This makes them both combustible and able to create a spark. Containers should have an earth connection in situations such as refilling the cisterns at petrol stations. \n\nSome flammable liquids have more than one dangerous property. Carbon disulfide is both flammable and toxic, and formaldehyde solutions can be both flammable and corrosive. \n\n2.4 Class 4.1. Flammable solids\nThis class consists of solids which are readily combustible, those which may cause or contribute to fire through friction, and self-reactive substances. Sulphur, red phosphorus and nitrocellulose films are common hazardous substances in this class. Examples of self-reactive compounds are azocarbamides, benzene sulphohydrazine and diazonium salts. Sawdust, hay and paper are not spontaneously flammable but are in this class because of incompatibility requirements in loading procedures. \nPicture 28 \nPicture 29 \nPicture 30 \n  \n\nRisks involved \n\nWhen flammable solids are handled there is a possibility of large amounts of dust being released in the air. These mixtures of dust and air can lead to a dust explosion. \n\nMany flammable solids give off hazardous fumes when they are burned. For example, the fumes of burning sulfur or red phosphorous are toxic and corrosive. \n\nThe decomposition of self-reactive substances can be initiated by heat, contact with catalytic impurities (acids, bases, heavy metal compounds), friction or impact. Decomposition may result in the emission of toxic gases and vapors. In order to ensure safety during transport, a self-reactive substance may be desensitized using a diluting agent compatible with the substance. \n\n2.5 Class 4.2. Substances liable to spontaneous combustion\nLinseed oil (used in paints), copra, oily cotton waste, carbon and white phosphorus are examples of substances which can ignite spontaneously when in contact with air. \nRisks involved \n\nThese substances are liable to act as a source of ignition for other goods and storage structures. \n\nFor example, there is a danger of fire if linseed oil spillages are wiped away with rags which then are left to dry in the air. The rags can stay inactive for days before they actually ignite. \n\n2.6 Class 4.3. Substances which in contact with water emit flammable gases\nCarbides are among the substances in Class 4.3. An extremely flammable gas, acetylene, is produced by adding water to calcium carbide. When sodium comes into contact with water it gives off hydrogen gas. The reaction is violent and produces enough heat to ignite hydrogen. Hydrogen burns explosively with such a hot flame that metallic material can start to burn. \nAluminum and magnesium powders, zinc dust and some metal hydrides are in this class. \n\nRisks involved \n\nIn addition to the dangers of fire and explosion, goods belonging to this class can react with moisture on human skin and cause burns. \n\n2.7 Class 5.1. Oxidizing substances\nIn this class are substances such as chlorates, chlorites, nitrates, nitrites, chromic acid and concentrated hydrogen peroxide solution. \nRisks involved \n\nThese goods should be carefully handled and protected from heat or friction. An oxidizing substance has oxygen bound into its structure. This is liberated by heating and can react with other materials or enhance fire. \n\nMany substances in this class are sensitive to impurities. Concentrated hydrogen peroxide solution begins to decompose if a few rust flakes happen to fall into the container. The reaction starts slowly but accelerates with time. It gives off oxygen which corrodes metallic materials. This can be devastating in transport by rail. \n\nThe decomposition of oxidizing goods can also involve liberation of toxic or corrosive gases, such as nitrogen oxides, which can be recognized from their deep brown to yellow brown color. \n\n2.7.1 Class 5.2. Organic peroxides\nThis class covers peroxides of organic compounds. They should never be transported or stored with combustible goods. Special recommendations and provisions apply to some of the peroxides because of their high reactivity. In addition to the hazards of explosive decomposition and fire, they are sensitive to impact or friction. Many peroxides are toxic and some of them can provoke allergic response or damage the eyes. \n2.8 Class 6.1. Toxic substances\nSubstances in this class are liable either to cause death or serious injury, or to be harmful when swallowed or inhaled or by skin contact. Toxic substances can be gases, solids or liquids. Toxic gases are listed into the Class 2.3. \nExamples of substances in this class are cyanides, arsenic compounds, mercury and lead compounds, nicotine, toluidines, chloroform, aniline and organotin compounds. \n\nIn order to compare the various risks involved, LD50 (lethal dose to 50%) and LC50 (lethal concentration to 50%) are used to appraise toxic properties. LD50 means the dose, at which half of the animals exposed (in test laboratory) to the poison die, and LC50 means the concentration which kills 50% of the tested animals after being exposed to the substance, usually by inhalation. \n\nThere are agreed limits for the levels of toxicity measured in animal tests, with reference to the route of exposure. \n\nThe packing group depends on the amount of the chemical and on the different degrees of health hazard that the chemical poses. \n\nDetailed advice about materials and ways of packing can be found in the United Nations Recommendations on the Transport of Dangerous Goods and in national regulations. \n\n2.9 Class 8. Corrosive substances\nThe corrosive substances class is a large one. It can be subdivided into acids, bases and other materials. \nExamples of acids include hydrochloric acid, sulfuric acid and acetic anhydride. Sodium hydroxide, potassium hydroxide, sodium carbonate and sodium metasilicate are bases or alkalis. Other corrosive substances include antimony pentachloride (textile impregnation), titanium tetrachloride, aluminum chloride and hypochlorites. \n\nThe health hazard varies from corrosive to irritating depending on the type and concentration of the active substance. \n\nThe corrosiveness of the substance is determined by its pH which measures the level of acidity or alkalinity. The following scale shows how the substance can be classified as corrosive or irritant: \n\npH      \n14      very alkaline (caustic soda)\n13\n12\n11\n10\n 9\n 8\n 7      neutral (water)\n 6\n 5\n 4\n 3\n 2\n 1      very acidic (nitric acid)          \nThe pH value can often be found on the label or in the documents following the substance. \nSome countries require that solutions must be classified, because of the corrosive effects, when the pH value is less than 1.5 or greater than 11.5. \n\nThe pH of some common substances in dilute water solutions is given below:\n \n Concentration Substance Smell pH Effect on skin \n 1% Hydrochloric acid sharp ~0.6 Slight feeling \n 1% Acetic acid typical ~2.8 None \n 1% Sodium hydroxide(caustic soda) none ~13.4 Strong \n 1% Ammonia sharp ~11.4 Irritating \n Acids and alkalis are normally transported at very high concentrations, e.g. 90-95% sulfuric acid, 65% nitric acid, 30% hydrochloric acid, 50% sodium hydroxide and 50% phosphoric acid. At these concentrations the pH value is not important, the substances are simply very corrosive. \nRisks involved \n\nThese substances can attack and corrode many materials, for example, clothe, paper and several metals. Decomposition often produces heat and gases, and in some cases extremely flammable hydrogen gas. The choose of a packing material and loading should carefully planned, because it can be some time before the consequences of corrosive effects are visible. \n\nAccidental mixing of different corrosive materials can in some cases lead to violent reactions, which may give off large amounts of gases. \n\nIn the case of strong alkalis there is a latent period before a burning feeling on the skin is experienced. By then the damage is already done. Skin contact with strong acids produces an immediate feeling. Both types of corrosive substances can cause serious skin damages. \n\nCorrosive material in the eyes requires a very rapid and long rinse with water (for at least 15 minutes) and medical attention. \n\nCorrosive substances can also present other hazards. For example, benzyl chloride is both toxic and corrosive, and cyclohexylamine is both corrosive and flammable. \n\n2.10 Class 9. Miscellaneous dangerous substances\nThese are substances and articles which during transport present a danger not covered by other classes. \nFor example magnetic materials can be classified in this category (magnetism may affect the navigation systems of aeroplanes). \n\nPCBs (polychlorinated biphenyls) are placed in Class 9 because they may damage the environment. \n\nDry ice (solid carbon dioxide) can evaporate, producing asphyxiant fumes, and displace oxygen in the air in confined places such as cargo holds in ships and storage cellars. \n\nAsbestos can damage the lungs. The effect on health is not immediate; the damage appears after many years. Therefore asbestos is not placed in Class 6.1 but in Class 9. \n\nConcentrated formaldehyde solutions are flammable, but if they are diluted with water the flash- point becomes higher than 60.5°C, which is the limit of flammables. The remaining hazards are still present, such as the allergic reactions caused by formaldehyde.",

Containers should have an earth connection in situations such as refilling the cisterns at petrol stations. \\n\\nSome flammable liquids have more than one dangerous property. Carbon disulfide is both flammable and toxic, and formaldehyde solutions can be both flammable and corrosive. \\n\\n2.4 Class 4.1. Flammable solids\\nThis class consists of solids which are readily combustible, those which may cause or contribute to fire through friction, and self-reactive substances. Sulphur, red phosphorus and nitrocellulose films are common hazardous substances in this class. Examples of self-reactive compounds are azocarbamides, benzene sulphohydrazine and diazonium salts. Sawdust, hay and paper are not spontaneously flammable but are in this class because of incompatibility requirements in loading procedures. \\nPicture 28 \\nPicture 29 \\nPicture 30 \\n  \\n\\nRisks involved \\n\\nWhen flammable solids are handled there is a possibility of large amounts of dust being released in the air. These mixtures of dust and air can lead to a dust explosion. \\n\\nMany flammable solids give off hazardous fumes when they are burned. For example, the fumes of burning sulfur or red phosphorous are toxic and corrosive. \\n\\nThe decomposition of self-reactive substances can be initiated by heat, contact with catalytic impurities (acids, bases, heavy metal compounds), friction or impact. Decomposition may result in the emission of toxic gases and vapors. In order to ensure safety during transport, a self-reactive substance may be desensitized using a diluting agent compatible with the substance. \\n\\n2.5 Class 4.2. Substances liable to spontaneous combustion\\nLinseed oil (used in paints), copra, oily cotton waste, carbon and white phosphorus are examples of substances which can ignite spontaneously when in contact with air. \\nRisks involved \\n\\nThese substances are liable to act as a source of ignition for other goods and storage structures. \\n\\nFor example, there is a danger of fire if linseed oil spillages are wiped away with rags which then are left to dry in the air. The rags can stay inactive for days before they actually ignite. \\n\\n2.6 Class 4.3. Substances which in contact with water emit flammable gases\\nCarbides are among the substances in Class 4.3. An extremely flammable gas, acetylene, is produced by adding water to calcium carbide. When sodium comes into contact with water it gives off hydrogen gas. The reaction is violent and produces enough heat to ignite hydrogen. Hydrogen burns explosively with such a hot flame that metallic material can start to burn. \\nAluminum and magnesium powders, zinc dust and some metal hydrides are in this class. \\n\\nRisks involved \\n\\nIn addition to the dangers of fire and explosion, goods belonging to this class can react with moisture on human skin and cause burns. \\n\\n2.7 Class 5.1. Oxidizing substances\\nIn this class are substances such as chlorates, chlorites, nitrates, nitrites, chromic acid and concentrated hydrogen peroxide solution. \\nRisks involved \\n\\nThese goods should be carefully handled and protected from heat or friction. An oxidizing substance has oxygen bound into its structure. This is liberated by heating and can react with other materials or enhance fire. \\n\\nMany substances in this class are sensitive to impurities. Concentrated hydrogen peroxide solution begins to decompose if a few rust flakes happen to fall into the container. The reaction starts slowly but accelerates with time. It gives off oxygen which corrodes metallic materials. This can be devastating in transport by rail. \\n\\nThe decomposition of oxidizing goods can also involve liberation of toxic or corrosive gases, such as nitrogen oxides, which can be recognized from their deep brown to yellow brown color. \\n\\n2.7.1 Class 5.2. Organic peroxides\\nThis class covers peroxides of organic compounds. They should never be transported or stored with combustible goods. Special recommendations and provisions apply to some of the peroxides because of their high reactivity. In addition to the hazards of explosive decomposition and fire, they are sensitive to impact or friction. Many peroxides are toxic and some of them can provoke allergic response or damage the eyes. \\n2.8 Class 6.1. Toxic substances\\nSubstances in this class are liable either to cause death or serious injury, or to be harmful when swallowed or inhaled or by skin contact. Toxic substances can be gases, solids or liquids. Toxic gases are listed into the Class 2.3. \\nExamples of substances in this class are cyanides, arsenic compounds, mercury and lead compounds, nicotine, toluidines, chloroform, aniline and organotin compounds. \\n\\nIn order to compare the various risks involved, LD50 (lethal dose to 50%) and LC50 (lethal concentration to 50%) are used to appraise toxic properties. LD50 means the dose, at which half of the animals exposed (in test laboratory) to the poison die, and LC50 means the concentration which kills 50% of the tested animals after being exposed to the substance, usually by inhalation. \\n\\nThere are agreed limits for the levels of toxicity measured in animal tests, with reference to the route of exposure. \\n\\nThe packing group depends on the amount of the chemical and on the different degrees of health hazard that the chemical poses. \\n\\nDetailed advice about materials and ways of packing can be found in the United Nations Recommendations on the Transport of Dangerous Goods and in national regulations. \\n\\n2.9 Class 8. Corrosive substances\\nThe corrosive substances class is a large one. It can be subdivided into acids, bases and other materials. \\nExamples of acids include hydrochloric acid, sulfuric acid and acetic anhydride. Sodium hydroxide, potassium hydroxide, sodium carbonate and sodium metasilicate are bases or alkalis. Other corrosive substances include antimony pentachloride (textile impregnation), titanium tetrachloride, aluminum chloride and hypochlorites. \\n\\nThe health hazard varies from corrosive to irritating depending on the type and concentration of the active substance. \\n\\nThe corrosiveness of the substance is determined by its pH which measures the level of acidity or alkalinity. The following scale shows how the substance can be classified as corrosive or irritant: \\n\\npH      \\n14      very alkaline (caustic soda)\\n13\\n12\\n11\\n10\\n 9\\n 8\\n 7      neutral (water)\\n 6\\n 5\\n 4\\n 3\\n 2\\n 1      very acidic (nitric acid)          \\nThe pH value can often be found on the label or in the documents following the substance. \\nSome countries require that solutions must be classified, because of the corrosive effects, when the pH value is less than 1.5 or greater than 11.5. \\n\\nThe pH of some common substances in dilute water solutions is given below:\\n \\n Concentration Substance Smell pH Effect on skin \\n 1% Hydrochloric acid sharp ~0.6 Slight feeling \\n 1% Acetic acid typical ~2.8 None \\n 1% Sodium hydroxide(caustic soda) none ~13.4 Strong \\n 1% Ammonia sharp ~11.4 Irritating \\n Acids and alkalis are normally transported at very high concentrations, e.g. 90-95% sulfuric acid, 65% nitric acid, 30% hydrochloric acid, 50% sodium hydroxide and 50% phosphoric acid. At these concentrations the pH value is not important, the substances are simply very corrosive. \\nRisks involved \\n\\nThese substances can attack and corrode many materials, for example, clothe, paper and several metals. Decomposition often produces heat and gases, and in some cases extremely flammable hydrogen gas. The choose of a packing material and loading should carefully planned, because it can be some time before the consequences of corrosive effects are visible. \\n\\nAccidental mixing of different corrosive materials can in some cases lead to violent reactions, which may give off large amounts of gases. \\n\\nIn the case of strong alkalis there is a latent period before a burning feeling on the skin is experienced. By then the damage is already done. Skin contact with strong acids produces an immediate feeling. Both types of corrosive substances can cause serious skin damages. \\n\\nCorrosive material in the eyes requires a very rapid and long rinse with water (for at least 15 minutes) and medical attention. \\n\\nCorrosive substances can also present other hazards. For example, benzyl chloride is both toxic and corrosive, and cyclohexylamine is both corrosive and flammable. \\n\\n2.10 Class 9. Miscellaneous dangerous substances\\nThese are substances and articles which during transport present a danger not covered by other classes. \\nFor example magnetic materials can be classified in this category (magnetism may affect the navigation systems of aeroplanes). \\n\\nPCBs (polychlorinated biphenyls) are placed in Class 9 because they may damage the environment. \\n\\nDry ice (solid carbon dioxide) can evaporate, producing asphyxiant fumes, and displace oxygen in the air in confined places such as cargo holds in ships and storage cellars. \\n\\nAsbestos can damage the lungs. The effect on health is not immediate; the damage appears after many years. Therefore asbestos is not placed in Class 6.1 but in Class 9. \\n\\nConcentrated formaldehyde solutions are flammable, but if they are diluted with water the flash- point becomes higher than 60.5°C, which is the limit of flammables. The remaining hazards are still present, such as the allergic reactions caused by formaldehyde.\",\"primaryKey\":[\"UnDangerousGoodsClassId\"],\"projectionInfo\":{\"attributes\":[{\"type\":\"Existing\",\"attributeReference\":{\"entity\":\"UnDangerousGoodsClass.cdm.json/UnDangerousGoodsClass\",\"name\":\"UnDangerousGoodsClassId\"},\"dataType\":\"integer\",\"description\":\"The unique identifier of a UN Dangerous Goods Class.\",\"isNullable\":false,\"name\":\"UnDangerousGoodsClassId\"},{\"type\":\"Existing\",\"attributeReference\":{\"entity\":\"UnDangerousGoodsClass.cdm.json/UnDangerousGoodsClass\",\"name\":\"UnDangerousGoodsClassName\"},\"dataType\":\"string\",\"dataTypeLength\":128,\"description\":\"The short or identifying name of a UN Dangerous Goods Class.\",\"isNullable\":true,\"name\":\"UnDangerousGoodsClassName\"},{\"type\":\"Existing\",\"attributeReference\":{\"entity\":\"UnDangerousGoodsClass.cdm.json/UnDangerousGoodsClass\",\"name\":\"UnDangerousGoodsClassDescription\"},\"dataType\":\"string\",\"dataTypeLength\":512,\"description\":\"The description of a UN Dangerous Goods Class.\",\"isNullable\":true,\"name\":\"UnDangerousGoodsClassDescription\"}]}}}",

MISCELLANEOUS DANGEROUS SUBSTANCES\n\nClasses of dangerous goods\nThe United Nations has published a book collecting the work of the Committee of Experts: Recommendations on the Transport of Dangerous Goods. These recommendations aim to present a basic, practical scheme of provisions that will allow national and international regulations governing various modes of transport to develop within it in a certain uniformity. The aim is to enable effective and successive transport and to ensure the safety of people, property, and the environment. \nIn these recommendations the goods are given an identification number and are divided into the following classes describing the inherent hazards: \n\nEXPLOSIVES  \nSubstances and articles which have a mass explosion hazard  \nSubstances and articles which have a projection hazard but not a mass explosion hazard  \nSubstances and articles which have a fire hazard and either a minor blast hazard or a minor projection hazard but not a mass explosion hazard  \nSubstances and articles which present no significant hazard  \nVery insensitive substances which have a mass explosion hazard  \nExtremely insensitive articles which do not have a mass explosion hazard  \nGASES  \nFlammable gases  \nNon-flammable, non-toxic gases  \nToxic gases  \nFLAMMABLE LIQUIDS  \nFLAMMABLE SOLIDS  \nFlammable solids  \nSubstances liable to spontaneous combustion  \nSubstances which in contact with water emit flammable gases  \nOXIDIZING SUBSTANCES; ORGANIC PEROXIDES  \nOxidizing substances  \nOrganic peroxides  \nPOISONOUS (=TOXIC) SUBSTANCES  \nToxic substances  \nInfectious substances  \nRADIOACTIVE MATERIAL  \nCORROSIVE SUBSTANCES  \nMISCELLANEOUS DANGEROUS SUBSTANCES  \nThe properties of the chemical substance or product have an effect on the choice of the packing material. Recommendations on the material, as well as the sizes, of packages are based on testing and experience. Dangerous goods of classes 3, 4, 5.1, 6.1, 8, and 9 have been divided for packing purposes into three groups according to the degree of danger they present: \ngreat danger - Packing Group I  \nmedium danger - Packing Group II  \nminor danger - Packing Group III  \nThe packing group related to a special substance, together with advice on packing methods, is listed in 'UN Recommendations on the Transport of Dangerous Goods' and in many national provisions. \nTo deal with goods having multiple risks a 'subsidiary risk' classification is used together with the principal hazard classification. \n\nSubstances and articles belonging to classes 1, 2, 4.1, 4.2, 4.3, 5.2, 6.2 and 7 often have more than one hazardous property and are subject to further restrictions. \n\nThese goods may be  \n\nexplosive  \nliable to spontaneous ignition or combustion  \nliberate flammable gases on contact with water  \ncontain infectious microorganisms that are known or reasonably believed to cause disease in animals or humans  \nradioactive  \ncompressed, condensed or pressurized dissolved gases, or organic peroxides  \nExamples of hazard classes: \n Substance or article Hazards \n UN Number Name and description Class Subsidiary risk \n 3017 Organophosphorus pesticides, liquid, flammable, flash-point not less than 23°C (Demeton, Fenthion, Parathion) 6.1 3 \n 1396 Aluminum powder, uncoated 4.3  \n 1005 Ammonia, solution with water, with more than 50% ammonia 2.3 8 \n 1789 Hydrochloric acid, solution 8  \n 1011 Butane 2.1  \n 2.1 Class 1. Explosives\nThis class contains articles, preparations, and substances such as ammunition, TNT, dynamite, nitrourea, fireworks. \nRisks involved \n\nA transport accident involves acute risk of explosion. The pressure wave can be devastating, and flying splinters may cause great damage. \n\nThe heat of the blast can result in a fire. \n\nSome substances in this class have toxic properties, e.g. nitroglycerin (in dynamite) is also classified as toxic and can penetrate through the skin. \n\nTransport of Class 1 articles or substances are subject to many restrictions, including quantity and temperature limits. They may also be incompatible with other goods. For example, dynamite should not go with detonators. \n\nPicture 26 \nPicture 27 \n\n2.2 Class 2. Gases\nThis class contains \ncompressed gases  \nliquefied gases  \nrefrigerated liquefied gases  \ncompressed gases, which, when packed for transport, are dissolved into a solvent.  \nThe term \"compressed\" refers to gases under pressure but not in a liquid state. Gases are usually stored in cylinders. When the valve is opened or broken, gas alone is released. The pressure of the cylinder depends on the type of gas it contains. The cylinders should always be kept within the approved temperature range to avoid a risk of overpressure causing an explosion hazard. Nitrogen (Class 2.2), hydrogen (2.1), oxygen (2.2 and 5.1) and helium (2.2) are compressed gases. \nCondensed gases are in a liquid state at relative low pressure. The contents are released as liquids which quickly evaporate forming gas clouds. \n\nThe size of the cloud can be considerable; for example, 1 liter of liquefied petroleum gas (LPG) forms up to 250 liters of gas. LPG, (propane, butane or a mixture of them, 'cooking gas')(Class 2.1); propene (2.1); vinyl chloride (2.1); freons; carbon dioxide (2.2); chlorine (2.3 and 5.1); ammonia (2.3 and 8) are commonly used gases in industry and are transported as condensed gases. \n\nSome condensed gases are stored at very low temperatures. They are transported in well- isolated containers called dewars. These must have a loosely covered opening to avoid dangerous overpressure. They pose special hazards due to their low temperature. For example, splashes of liquefied nitrogen can cause frostbite and the gas cloud is an asphyxiant. \n\nIn a train accident several tank wagons filled with liquefied propane turned over spilling their contents. The propane started to evaporate cooling the surroundings to -43oC, which is the boiling temperature of propane. Several persons in the spill area were frozen to death. With good luck and tight security the highly flammable propane gas did not explode. \n\nAn example of a dissolved gas is acetylene (Class 2.1). Acetylene cylinders are filled with inert very porous, non-combustible material which is wetted with acetylene. \n\nAerosols and small receptacles which contain flammable propellant gases belong to this class. \n\nRisks involved \n\nSubstances in Class 2 are assigned to one of three categories based on the primary hazard of the gas. \n\n2.2.1 Class 2.1. Flammable gases\nThis category includes those gases that at normal pressure and temperature, as a mixture of 13% or less with air, can ignite from a source of fire such as a spark. \n2.2.2 Class 2.2. Non-flammable, non-toxic gases\nIncluded in this category are gases which might replace oxygen and are asphyxiant (nitrogen, carbon dioxide), or which are oxidizing and may contribute to the combustion of other materials more than air does (pure oxygen is an example). \n2.2.3 Class 2.3. Toxic gases\nGases which are known to be poisonous or corrosive enough to pose a health hazard belong to this category (carbon monoxide, ethylene oxide, hydrogen sulfide, sulfur dioxide and ammonia). Containers with toxic gases should never be loaded or stored together with food or feedstuffs. \nAcidic gases can react with alkaline gases to produce heat and smoke, which may create a fire risk. \n\nSome gases have more than one dangerous property. They can be both flammable and toxic (methyl ether) or corrosive and toxic (hydrogen chloride, phosgene, chlorine). \n\n2.3 Class 3. Flammable liquids\nA flammable liquid has the ability to give of, at normal temperatures, vapors which are flammable (e.g., benzene, kerosene, toluene, propanol and various organic solvents used in pesticides). This class also covers mixtures of liquids, as well as liquids containing solids in solution or suspension (paints, varnishes, lacquers, etc.). Petroleum products and crude oil also belong to Class 3. \nRisks involved \n\nFlammable liquids pose a risk of fire and explosion, and may lead to expensive environmental clean- up operations (accidents at sea to oil tankers). \n\nThe flammability of a liquid depends on several characteristic properties. \n\nFlash-point describes the lowest temperature at which a liquid gives off sufficient amount of flammable gas to form a mixture with air which will ignite when a flame or spark is present. If the flash-point is tested to be not more than 60.5°C, the substance belongs to Class 3. \n\nMany flammable liquids can be charged with static electricity, for example, as result of flowing in a pipe. This makes them both combustible and able to create a spark. Containers should have an earth connection in situations such as refilling the cisterns at petrol stations. \n\nSome flammable liquids have more than one dangerous property. Carbon disulfide is both flammable and toxic, and formaldehyde solutions can be both flammable and corrosive. \n\n2.4 Class 4.1. Flammable solids\nThis class consists of solids which are readily combustible, those which may cause or contribute to fire through friction, and self-reactive substances. Sulphur, red phosphorus and nitrocellulose films are common hazardous substances in this class. Examples of self-reactive compounds are azocarbamides, benzene sulphohydrazine and diazonium salts. Sawdust, hay and paper are not spontaneously flammable but are in this class because of incompatibility requirements in loading procedures. \nPicture 28 \nPicture 29 \nPicture 30 \n  \n\nRisks involved \n\nWhen flammable solids are handled there is a possibility of large amounts of dust being released in the air. These mixtures of dust and air can lead to a dust explosion. \n\nMany flammable solids give off hazardous fumes when they are burned. For example, the fumes of burning sulfur or red phosphorous are toxic and corrosive. \n\nThe decomposition of self-reactive substances can be initiated by heat, contact with catalytic impurities (acids, bases, heavy metal compounds), friction or impact. Decomposition may result in the emission of toxic gases and vapors. In order to ensure safety during transport, a self-reactive substance may be desensitized using a diluting agent compatible with the substance. \n\n2.5 Class 4.2. Substances liable to spontaneous combustion\nLinseed oil (used in paints), copra, oily cotton waste, carbon and white phosphorus are examples of substances which can ignite spontaneously when in contact with air. \nRisks involved \n\nThese substances are liable to act as a source of ignition for other goods and storage structures. \n\nFor example, there is a danger of fire if linseed oil spillages are wiped away with rags which then are left to dry in the air. The rags can stay inactive for days before they actually ignite. \n\n2.6 Class 4.3. Substances which in contact with water emit flammable gases\nCarbides are among the substances in Class 4.3. An extremely flammable gas, acetylene, is produced by adding water to calcium carbide. When sodium comes into contact with water it gives off hydrogen gas. The reaction is violent and produces enough heat to ignite hydrogen. Hydrogen burns explosively with such a hot flame that metallic material can start to burn. \nAluminum and magnesium powders, zinc dust and some metal hydrides are in this class. \n\nRisks involved \n\nIn addition to the dangers of fire and explosion, goods belonging to this class can react with moisture on human skin and cause burns. \n\n2.7 Class 5.1. Oxidizing substances\nIn this class are substances such as chlorates, chlorites, nitrates, nitrites, chromic acid and concentrated hydrogen peroxide solution. \nRisks involved \n\nThese goods should be carefully handled and protected from heat or friction. An oxidizing substance has oxygen bound into its structure. This is liberated by heating and can react with other materials or enhance fire. \n\nMany substances in this class are sensitive to impurities. Concentrated hydrogen peroxide solution begins to decompose if a few rust flakes happen to fall into the container. The reaction starts slowly but accelerates with time. It gives off oxygen which corrodes metallic materials. This can be devastating in transport by rail. \n\nThe decomposition of oxidizing goods can also involve liberation of toxic or corrosive gases, such as nitrogen oxides, which can be recognized from their deep brown to yellow brown color. \n\n2.7.1 Class 5.2. Organic peroxides\nThis class covers peroxides of organic compounds. They should never be transported or stored with combustible goods. Special recommendations and provisions apply to some of the peroxides because of their high reactivity. In addition to the hazards of explosive decomposition and fire, they are sensitive to impact or friction. Many peroxides are toxic and some of them can provoke allergic response or damage the eyes. \n2.8 Class 6.1. Toxic substances\nSubstances in this class are liable either to cause death or serious injury, or to be harmful when swallowed or inhaled or by skin contact. Toxic substances can be gases, solids or liquids. Toxic gases are listed into the Class 2.3. \nExamples of substances in this class are cyanides, arsenic compounds, mercury and lead compounds, nicotine, toluidines, chloroform, aniline and organotin compounds. \n\nIn order to compare the various risks involved, LD50 (lethal dose to 50%) and LC50 (lethal concentration to 50%) are used to appraise toxic properties. LD50 means the dose, at which half of the animals exposed (in test laboratory) to the poison die, and LC50 means the concentration which kills 50% of the tested animals after being exposed to the substance, usually by inhalation. \n\nThere are agreed limits for the levels of toxicity measured in animal tests, with reference to the route of exposure. \n\nThe packing group depends on the amount of the chemical and on the different degrees of health hazard that the chemical poses. \n\nDetailed advice about materials and ways of packing can be found in the United Nations Recommendations on the Transport of Dangerous Goods and in national regulations. \n\n2.9 Class 8. Corrosive substances\nThe corrosive substances class is a large one. It can be subdivided into acids, bases and other materials. \nExamples of acids include hydrochloric acid, sulfuric acid and acetic anhydride. Sodium hydroxide, potassium hydroxide, sodium carbonate and sodium metasilicate are bases or alkalis. Other corrosive substances include antimony pentachloride (textile impregnation), titanium tetrachloride, aluminum chloride and hypochlorites. \n\nThe health hazard varies from corrosive to irritating depending on the type and concentration of the active substance. \n\nThe corrosiveness of the substance is determined by its pH which measures the level of acidity or alkalinity. The following scale shows how the substance can be classified as corrosive or irritant: \n\npH      \n14      very alkaline (caustic soda)\n13\n12\n11\n10\n 9\n 8\n 7      neutral (water)\n 6\n 5\n 4\n 3\n 2\n 1      very acidic (nitric acid)          \nThe pH value can often be found on the label or in the documents following the substance. \nSome countries require that solutions must be classified, because of the corrosive effects, when the pH value is less than 1.5 or greater than 11.5. \n\nThe pH of some common substances in dilute water solutions is given below:\n \n Concentration Substance Smell pH Effect on skin \n 1% Hydrochloric acid sharp ~0.6 Slight feeling \n 1% Acetic acid typical ~2.8 None \n 1% Sodium hydroxide(caustic soda) none ~13.4 Strong \n 1% Ammonia sharp ~11.4 Irritating \n Acids and alkalis are normally transported at very high concentrations, e.g. 90-95% sulfuric acid, 65% nitric acid, 30% hydrochloric acid, 50% sodium hydroxide and 50% phosphoric acid. At these concentrations the pH value is not important, the substances are simply very corrosive. \nRisks involved \n\nThese substances can attack and corrode many materials, for example, clothe, paper and several metals. Decomposition often produces heat and gases, and in some cases extremely flammable hydrogen gas. The choose of a packing material and loading should carefully planned, because it can be some time before the consequences of corrosive effects are visible. \n\nAccidental mixing of different corrosive materials can in some cases lead to violent reactions, which may give off large amounts of gases. \n\nIn the case of strong alkalis there is a latent period before a burning feeling on the skin is experienced. By then the damage is already done. Skin contact with strong acids produces an immediate feeling. Both types of corrosive substances can cause serious skin damages. \n\nCorrosive material in the eyes requires a very rapid and long rinse with water (for at least 15 minutes) and medical attention. \n\nCorrosive substances can also present other hazards. For example, benzyl chloride is both toxic and corrosive, and cyclohexylamine is both corrosive and flammable. \n\n2.10 Class 9. Miscellaneous dangerous substances\nThese are substances and articles which during transport present a danger not covered by other classes. \nFor example magnetic materials can be classified in this category (magnetism may affect the navigation systems of aeroplanes). \n\nPCBs (polychlorinated biphenyls) are placed in Class 9 because they may damage the environment. \n\nDry ice (solid carbon dioxide) can evaporate, producing asphyxiant fumes, and displace oxygen in the air in confined places such as cargo holds in ships and storage cellars. \n\nAsbestos can damage the lungs. The effect on health is not immediate; the damage appears after many years. Therefore asbestos is not placed in Class 6.1 but in Class 9. \n\nConcentrated formaldehyde solutions are flammable, but if they are diluted with water the flash- point becomes higher than 60.5°C, which is the limit of flammables. The remaining hazards are still present, such as the allergic reactions caused by formaldehyde.",
